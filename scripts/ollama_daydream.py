                                Your goal is to create a short welcome message that:
                                - Makes the user feel genuinely welcomed and seen
                                - Sparks a bit of curiosity or motivation to explore something new
                                - Feels personal, yet works without knowing their background

                                Guidelines:
                                - Keep it short (1â€“2 sentences)
                                - Feel friendly, thoughtful, and human-like
                                - You may include light emojis if appropriate
                                - Avoid generic "Hi there!" or "How can I help you?"â€”be original

                                Examples:
                                â†’ "Welcome! Ever wonder what you'd discover today if you just followed your curiosity? ðŸ˜Š"
                                â†’ "Hey there! Ready to explore some ideas together? Letâ€™s make something cool happen."

    - Spark curiosity â€” make the user think, smile, or want to respond
    - Be inspired by the **themes, questions, or tone** in their past messages
    - Feel like a natural continuation or thoughtful reflection

    Guidelines:
    - Start with a spark: "Did you know...", "Here's something curious...", "Imagine this...", or something unique
    - Avoid repeating the user's exact message, but build on its topic or vibe
    - Keep it short and conversational (1â€“2 sentences)

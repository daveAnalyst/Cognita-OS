# LogOS ðŸ§ âœ¨

A new kind of Thinking Operating System. A private, local-first "Lab Partner" designed for **cognitive augmentation**, not just task automation.

## The Vision: Beyond the AI Butler

For 50 years, the computing paradigm has been reactive. The current wave of AI offers "butlers" that make us more efficient at tasks. We believe this is a dead end. The real revolution is an AI **"Lab Partner"** that makes us more *intelligent*.

**Logos OS** is an open-source project to build the architectural foundation for this new paradigm. We are not trying to replace the low-level kernel (like Linux or Windows); we are building a new, intelligent **application-level OS** that sits on top, orchestrating models and tools to create a true Socratic partnership with the user.

## The First Product: "Wise: The Sovereign Edition"

As our entry for the **Google Gemma 3n Impact Challenge**, we are building `Wise`â€”the first application powered by Logos OS. It is a powerful tool for "prosumers"â€”researchers, strategists, developers, and ambitious students whose primary job is to think.

*   **100% Local & Sovereign:** Runs entirely on your machine using Ollama and local models like Gemma 3n. Your data never leaves your device.
*   **A "Second Brain":** Ingests your private documents (PDFs, notes, images) to create a local, searchable knowledge base.
*   **Cognitive Lenses:** Dynamically shift the AI's entire reasoning style (e.g., from a meticulous **Scholar ðŸŽ“** to a creative **Muse ðŸŽ¨**) to match your cognitive task.
*   **Proactive Insights:** A background "Insights Engine" acts as a computational "dream/drift cycle," finding novel connections between your ideas.
*   **Post-GUI Interaction:** We are prototyping a gestural interface to create a truly immersive thinking environment.

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** In active development for the Kaggle Gemma 3n Impact Challenge (Deadline: August 6, 2025). We are currently in **Sprint 1**, building the core desktop application framework.

**High-Level Roadmap:**
1.  **Q3 2025:** Launch the free "Wise: Sovereign Edition" experimental desktop app.
2.  **Q4 2025:** Open-source the core orchestration framework.
3.  **2026:** Launch the "Wise Cloud" subscription for optional sync and the first version of the "Nexus" agent SDK.

## Getting Involved

We are building this in public and believe in the power of community.

*   **For Users & Thinkers:** If our vision resonates with you, join the conversation! We'd love to hear your ideas. The best way to get on the early access list for the `Wise` app is to **DM us on X (Twitter)**.
*   **For Developers:** We will be open-sourcing our core SDK in the future. The best way to stay updated is to **Star this repository** and watch for announcements.

## Architecture & Documentation

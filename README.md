## The Problem We're Solving

Today's AI makes you **faster**, but not **smarter**. It's an "AI Butler" that does tasks *for* you instead of thinking *with* you.

> **The Market's Vision:** *"Hey AI, join my meetings, stay muted, and just say 'nothing from my end' when asked."* — Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity

**Our Vision:** What if AI didn't just attend your meeting, but actively cross-referenced the discussion with your private knowledge base and alerted you: *"They're debating the Q4 roadmap, but it conflicts with engineering constraints you documented last week. You might want to speak up."*

**The Butler frees your time. The Lab Partner amplifies your impact.**

## Meet Wise: Your First AI Lab Partner

**Wise** is the flagship application of EngelBERT OS—an Integrated Thinking Environment that augments your intelligence rather than replacing it.

### How Wise Works: A Student's Story

Meet Alex, who's struggling with scattered lecture notes and complex connections:

1. **📥 Ingest**: Alex drags messy PDFs and class notes into Wise's local "Second Brain"
2. **🧠 Augment**: He activates the **Scholar Lens** 🎓 and asks: *"Create a cheat sheet on French Revolution causes"*
3. **⚡ Insight**: Wise proactively surfaces: *"Your Enlightenment notes connect strongly with American Revolutionary Ideas in Chapter 4. Explore this link?"*

## Core Innovations

### 🏛️ Progressive Sovereignty
- **Any Hardware**: Fast, text-only experience on basic machines via `llama-cpp-python`
- **Enhanced Locally**: Unlocks full `Gemma 3n` multimodal features when Ollama is detected
- **Your Data**: 100% offline-capable. No cloud dependencies for core functionality

### 🔍 Cognitive Lenses
Dynamic reasoning modes inspired by the human mind that transform how the AI thinks:
- **🎓 Scholar**: Analytical, research-focused
- **🎨 Muse**: Creative, exploratory
- **🔧 Reflective**: Inspired by CBT therapy- A FINETUNED gemma3n for metacognition

Powered by our `VibeDetector` agent that automatically knows and adapts to your intent.

### 🌐 Personal Ontology
Your private, on-device knowledge graph that enables:
- **Proactive Insights**: AI discovers non-obvious connections without being asked
- **Context Awareness**: Every response is informed by your personal knowledge base
- **True Privacy**: Your thoughts never leave your device

## The Evolution: From Tool to Ambient Intelligence

**Wise is just the beginning.** We're building toward a new Post GUI computing paradigm: Where Man and Machine have true ptnership

| Phase | Product | Vision |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Today** | 💻 **Sovereign Desktop** | Powerful local multimodl AI-system that proves privacy and capability can coexist |
| **Tomorrow** | 💾 **Sage Stick** | Zero-dependency portable intelligence on a flash drive |
| **Future** | 📻 **Smart Radio** | Screenless, voice-first ambient AI that frees you from screens |

<strong>EngelBERT</strong> is the open-source operating system for augmented thinking—our long-term platform vision.
<br><br>
<strong>Wise</strong> is the first application built on EngelBERT—a concrete product you can download and use today.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from ChatGPT or Claude?</strong></summary>
<br>
Traditional AI chat interfaces are reactive—they wait for you to ask questions. Wise is <strong>proactive</strong>—it analyzes your knowledge base and surfaces insights you didn't know to look for. Plus, it works entirely offline with your private data.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use other AI models?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes! Our architecture is model-agnostic. While we showcase `Gemma 3n`, you can integrate any model available through Ollama or sny other thing using an APIs. Think of it as a smart orchestrator for your AI tools.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What does this cost?</strong></summary>
<br>
The core Wise desktop application is <strong>free and open-source forever</strong>. We believe private intelligence augmentation is a fundamental right, not a luxury.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about mobile support?</strong></summary>
<br>
Our immediate focus is perfecting the desktop experience and launching the "Sage Stick" portable version. Mobile support is on our roadmap for 2025.

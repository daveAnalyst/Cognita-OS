## The Unfinished Revolution: From AI Butler to Lab Partner

For 60 years, the reactive GUI has defined computing, casting the user as a low-level operator. The current wave of AI, while powerful, reinforces this paradigm by creating hyper-efficient "AI Butlers" for task automation.

**Engelbert is a fundamental rethinking of this relationship.**

Inspired by the vision of Douglas Engelbart, we are building an AI-native operating system that functions as a Socratic **"AI Lab Partner"** for cognitive augmentation. It's an "attention shield" designed not to capture your focus, but to amplify itâ€”helping you think with more depth, creativity, and clarity.

## Wise: The Sovereign Scholar Edition (Our MVP)

**Wise** is the flagship application built on the Engelbert OS architecture. It is the first Integrated Thinking Environment (ITE) designed for students, researchers, and developers.

- **What it is:** A free, 100% offline-first desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Cognitive Sovereignty:** Your data, models, and thoughts never leave your machine.
- **Killer Feature:** The "Cheat Sheet" generator, using a local RAG pipeline to analyze and synthesize your private documents and notes.
- **"Wow" Feature:** A "Cognitive Screenshot" and gesture-based controls, demonstrating our post-GUI vision.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

Engelbert is an **application-level "meta" OS** that runs on top of existing operating systems.

- **The Kernel ("SageMind Orchestrator"):** A Python backend powered by FastAPI that runs as a local sidecar. Its core logic is the **DPES (Deconstruct-Plan-Execute-Synthesize)** loop.
- **The "Second Brain":** A local-first database using SQLite for structured data and LanceDB for vector storage.
- **The Frontend:** A reactive UI built with Next.js and TypeScript.
- **The Desktop Shell:** Packaged into a native desktop app using Tauri.
- **The AI:** Designed for multi-model orchestration, running local LLMs via Ollama.

## Getting Started (Development Setup)

This project uses a three-terminal setup for development to provide clear, isolated logs for each part of the system.

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.9+ and pip
- Rust and Cargo
- Ollama installed and running

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Update 'your-github-username' after renaming the repo
git clone https://github.com/daveANALYST/EngelBERT.git
cd Engelbert

**Terminal 1: Launch the backend**
```bash
cd src-backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
pip install "fastapi[all]"
uvicorn main:app --reload

**Terminal 2, Launch the frontend**
```bash
cd src-frontend
npm install
npm run dev

**Terminal 3: Launch the Tauri App:**
```bash
cd src-frontend
npm run tauri dev

A native desktop window will now launch, displaying the UI from the frontend server.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo containing the entire Engelbert system.

- `/src-frontend/`: The Next.js and Tauri frontend application.
- `/src-backend/`: The Python, FastAPI, and AI orchestration backend (the "kernel").
- `/docs/`: Project documentation, media assets, and the vision paper.

## Roadmap

- âœ… **Sprint 1: The Steel Frame.**  
  *Goal:* Achieve a working end-to-end connection where the Tauri UI can communicate with the Python backend via a local API call.
- ðŸ”„ **Sprint 2: The Thinking Kernel.**  
  *Goal:* Integrate Ollama into the backend, allowing the UI to send a prompt and receive a response from a local LLM. Implement the first version of the "Cheat Sheet" RAG pipeline.
- **Sprint 3: The Second Brain.**  
  *Goal:* Build the document ingestion pipeline and the SQLite/LanceDB database architecture.

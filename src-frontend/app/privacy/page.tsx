            <p>
              Engelbert and its flagship application, "Wise," are designed from the ground up on the principle of **Cognitive Sovereignty**. This means that your data, your thoughts, your documents, and your insights are processed and stored exclusively on your local machine.

            <p>
              Our servers never see your personal content. We do not collect, store, or have access to any of the data you create or process within the "Wise: Sovereign Edition" application. This includes:

            <p>
              In the future, we may offer optional cloud features. These services will be strictly opt-in, using a **"Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK)** model. If you choose to use a cloud AI model (e.g., from OpenAI), you will use your own API key. Your data will be sent directly from your device to their service, under their privacy policy. We act as an orchestrator, not a middleman.

            <p>
              When you visit our website or sign up for our waitlist, we collect only the essential information needed to communicate with you (your email address). We use simple, privacy-respecting analytics to understand website traffic. We will never sell your information.
